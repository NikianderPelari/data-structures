The file cityxy.txt contains a list of cities and their (X,Y) coordinates on the map. These are the vertices in the graph. 
The file citypairs.txt lists direct, connections between pairs of cities. These links are bidirectional, if you can from NewYork to Boston,
you can get from Boston to NewYork. These are the edges of the graph.


If you use an IDE, import the java files and make sure that citxy.txt and citypairs.txt are placed in the project directory. 
If you use java and javac from the command line put the files in the same directory as the source files.
Compile all java sources and run the program Display.
